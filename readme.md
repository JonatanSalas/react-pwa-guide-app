# react-pwa-starter-kit

> Progressive Web App Starter Kit with React.js is an designed to discover and understand how to build up Progressive Web Apps features by React.js development environments. Customized and opinionated tools and build process are optimized to achive high-performed web application audited by strict auditor, [Lighthsuse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse). Moreover, this starte kit is backed by Firebase for hosting, realtime database, and also push notification.

# Features

- Material Design and AppShell: Responsive, fit any form factor, desktop but first is mobile. AppShell architecture implemented wearing material design got bressed by [material-ui.com](https://material-ui.com)|

- Server Side Rendering: Presenting intial page in short time is an important issue. This starter kit includes 
simple server side code for demonstration. Buidling PWA for Server Side Rendering version landed You can take a look what is different between both of versions

# Getting Started

## Setup

To use filrebase cli tool, you must setup firelbase cli and then logged into firebase by `firebase login`. To do this please refer to [firebase cli guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/). And then you need to create a new project on firebase and get the intialize codes from firebase, which are API_KEY, MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, DATABASE_URL, to save at .env. If you're not familiar with a brand new filrebase? you can have a look for [official guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install

# firebase init, input with following answers
# select hosting only
# select your project or create one
# input build for public directory
# answer no for configuration as a single-page app
firebase init

# update values in .env with the intialize codes from firebase
# and then rename .env.example in compliance with loading env as build
mv .env.example .env
```

## Build

We support three versions of build, production, development(debug) and ssr. All of build files will be in `./build`

```sh
# build in production
yarn build

# build in ssr version
yarn build:ssr

# build in debug
yarn build:debug
```

## Run PWA on Server

```sh
# starting app by webpack-dev-server, no-ssr
yarn start

# starting app by ssr server
yarn build:ssr && yarn start:ssr
```

## Deployment

You need to check that configuration again. You must have a project on firebase, this project have the suitable settings for firebase generated by fireblase cli and .env file must be exist with the initialize code from firebase

```sh
# deploy to firebase
yarn deploy
```
# Working Demo

This PWA is [running on firebase hosting](https://react-pwa-hello-world.firebaseapp.com/#/)
